    <title>Running Hello World in Eclipse</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This Cougaar demo has been set up so that it can easily be run
      in Eclipse, either in a new workspace created for that purpose,
      or in existing workspace if you already have one for
      Cougaar-related work.
    </p>
    <p> 
      We assume the reader is already familiar with Eclipse, and we
      recommend using Eclipse 3.3 or later.  Some sections also assume
      you already have a Cougaar society of your own for which some
      portion of the code is already in an Eclipse workspace.
    </p>
    
   <h2> CVS checkout of Cougaar Tutorial Modules in Eclipse </h2>
    <p> For reference, here is a complete sequence of operations for
      running the "hello" demo in Eclipse, starting from scratch.
      Following sections go into the steps in more detail.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="http://eclipse.org">Install Eclipse</a></li>
      <li>Start Eclipse</li>
      <li>"select a workspace" to an empty directory</li>
      <li>Switch to the "Workbench"</li>
      <li>Add Cougaar Tutorials CVS repository >
        <ol>
          <li>Enter CVS prospective menu: Window -> Open Prosective -> others -> CVS</li>
          <li>Select "add CVS Repository" button</li>
          <li>Add Cougaar tutorial repository information:

        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Observe the output in Console tab
        <ul>
          <li>Console prints "A: Hello, Load!" </li>
          <li>Console prints "..." </li>
          <li>Console prints "A: Bye: Crashing Node Now!"</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>TrimCougaar project</h2>
    <p>
    The TrimCougaar project can be used as the Cougaar Installation for both eclipse and 
    file-based installation. TrimCougaar has the same structure, 
    but has only the essential jar and configuration files. COUGAAR-INSTALL-PATH can be set 
    to TrimCougaar directory. A file based installation may look like:
    <ol><code>
    <br>mkdir /usr/local/cougaar 
    <br>cd /usr/local/cougaar
    <br>cvs -d :ext:cougaar.org:/cvsroot/tutorials co TrimCougaar
    <br>export COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH=/usr/local/cougaar/TrimCougaar
    </code></ol>
    </p>
    

    <h2>Defining the "cougaar" User Library</h2>
    <a name="user-lib"/>
    <p>
      If Cougaar is installed external to your eclipse workspace, then you
      should create an Eclipse User Library containing the Cougaar jars. 
      This is a generic method for importing Cougaar jars, without using the TrimCougaar module.
    </p>
    <p>
    Any projects that depend on Cougaar, including HelloWorld, can
    get at the Cougaar jars simply by including the "cougaar"
    User Library on the project's build path.
    </p>
    <p>
      To create a User Library in Eclipse, do the following:

      <ol>
        <li>Open the Preferences and navigate to <i>Java -> Build Path ->
      User Libraries</i>.  In Windows and Linux the Preferences are
      accesible from the <i>Window</i> menu.  In MacOSX they're
      accessible from the <i>Eclipse</i> menu.</li>

        <li>Click <i>New</i> to create a new library.  Give it the
        name "cougaar".</li>

        <li>Select that library, click <i>Add Jars...</i> and add all
        the jars (and only jar files)
        from <code>$COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/lib</code></li>

        <li>Select the library again, click <i>Add Jars...</i> and add all
        the jars (and only jar files and not, say, index.html)
        from <code>$COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/sys</code></li>
      </ol>
    </p>
 
    <h2>Running the Hello World demo in a new workspace</h2>
    <p>
    The Hello world eclipse project depends on both the TrimCougaar project and the "cougaar" User Library.
    So either method should setup the hello project environment.
      <ol>
        
        <li>Create a new Eclipse workspace.</li>

        <li>Define the "cougaar" User Library or checkout CougaarTrim project as described
        above.</li>

        <li>Import the HelloWorld project (see <a href="#import">below</a>
        if you don't know how to do this).</li>

        <li>Open the Run Dialog, expand the list of Java Applications,
        and select "hello".
        
      </ol>
      <p>The demo can now be run or debugged or profiled in Eclipse.
      </p>

    </p>

    <h2>Extending an existing Eclipse workspace</h2>
    <p>
       If you already have an Eclipse workspace configured to develop
      software for a Cougaar society, you may find it convenient to
      import the "hello" society in order to have a 'template' run
      configuration. 
    </p>

    <h3>Adding Hello World to your existing workspace</h3>
    <p>
      The first two steps for this have already been described:  
      <a href="#user-lib">create the "cougaar" User Library</a> and
      <a href="#import">import the "hello" project</a>.  In this case
      the import is being done not to run the demo but to give you
      access to a working Eclipse run config.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you should add the "cougaar" User Library as a dependency in
      your own project's build path.  If your project already had
      explicit dependencies on Cougaar jars, those should be removed.
      If you don't know how to edit the Build Path, the procedure is
      described in detail below. Otherwise, feel free to skip this
      section.
    
      <h4>Adding "cougaar" to your Build Path</h4>
      <a name="buildpath"/>
    <p>
      To edit your project's Build Path:

      <ol>
        <li>Right-click the project's name in the Package Explorer and
          select <i>Build Path -> Configure Build Path</i> from the
          menu.</li>

        <li>Select the <i>Libraries</i> tab.</li>

        <li>Click <i>Add Library</i>.</li>

        <li>Click <i>User Library</i> in the dialog that appears,
        then click the <i>Next</i> button.</li>

        <li> Check the box next to "cougaar" and click <i>Finish</i>.</li>

        <li>Since the "cougaar" User Library includes all the Cougaar
        jars, you should remove any explicit dependencies your own
        project might have already had on specific ones, for example
        core.jar.  Select all such jars that appear in
        the <i>Libraries</i> tab of the Build Path dialog, then click
        the <i>Remove</i> button in the right button panel.</li>

        <li>
          Click the <i>OK</i> button at the bottom to save your
          changes and exit the dialog.
        </li>
      </ol>


    <h3>Running your own Cougaar society</h3>
    <p> Once you have the "hello" project in your own Cougaar workspace you
      can easily run your societies in Eclipse by cloning the "hello"
      run configuration and making a few modifications.  To make a clone, simply
      open <i>Open Run Dialog</i>, select "hello", and click the
      duplicate button in the toolbar (second from left).  Now change
      the clone's name to something more meaningful, change its
      project to be your project and click <i>Apply</i> to save the
      changes so far.  Leave the <i>Main Class</i> set to
      "org.cougaar.bootstrap.bootstrapper".
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point switch from the <i>Main</i> tab to
      the <i>Arguments</i> tab. Change the <i>Working directory</i> to
      something meaningful for your project, typically the directory
      that contains the society runtime xml and webtomcat if you use
      servlets.  For portability it's convenient to make this relative
      to the project root, since this will allow you to use the
      Eclipse reference ${project_loc:xxx}, where xxx is the project
      name.  The "hello" configuration is like this. A run
      configuration set up in this relative way can be checked in and
      shared with other users.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, you need to adjust the VM arguments to be suitable for
      your society.  The exact details depend on the society, but in
      general the VM args can be divided into three categories:
    </p>

    <ul>
    
      <li> Some values are society-specific and must be adjusted to
      match your project.  These include:

        <dl>
           <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.society.path=${project_loc:hello}</b></dt>
           <dd>
             Replace the value with location of your project root.
           </dd>

           <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.runtime.path=${project_loc:hello}/run</b></dt>
           <dd>
             Replace value with the run (working) directory in your project root.
           </dd>

           <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.society.file=${project_loc:hello}/configs/HelloWorldSociety.xml</b></dt>
           <dd>
             Replace the value with a path to your society xml.
             Typically this would be a 'configs' directory under the
             project root.
           </dd>

           <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.runtime.file=SingleNodeRuntime.xml</b></dt>
           <dd>
             Replace the value with the path to your society runtime
             xml, relative to the run (working) directory you set above.
           </dd>

           <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.node.name=Node1</b></dt>
           <dd>
             Replace the value with name of the node from the society xml file you want to run.
           </dd>

        </dl>
      </li>
 
      <li> Other values define the runtime environment,
      but you might need to adjust them.  These include:
        <dl>
          <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.name.server=NameServer@localhost:8888</b></dt>
          <dd>
            If your society includes multiple nodes running on
            multiple hosts, replace 'localhost' with the fully
            qualified domain name of the host running the node that
            contains the NameServer agent.
          </dd>

          <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.society.xsl.param.template=single_node</b></dt>
          <dd>
            Adjust this if you want to run your society in an environment other than a
            stand alone node. (see 
            <a href="http://cougaar.org/wp/documentation/special-topics/templates-support/">
            templates</a>)
            
          </dd>

          <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.society.xsl.param.planning=false</b></dt>
          <dd>
            Set to true if you want to use the task servlet to inspect objects on the blackboard.
          </dd>

          <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.core.agent.quiet=true</b></dt>
          <dd>
            Set to false if you want to see +/- printed on the console 
            for each message sent/received.
          </dd>

          <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.core.agent.heartbeat=false</b></dt>
          <dd>
            Set to true if you want a "." printed on the console every 5 seconds.
          </dd>

          <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.core.logging.config.filename=logging.props</b></dt>
          <dd>
            If you want to use your own log4j properties file, put
            the path to that file here.
          </dd>

 
        </dl>

      </li>


      <li> Some values are fixed for all societies.  These include:
        <dl>
          <dt><b>-Dorg.xml.sax.driver=com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.parsers.SAXParser</b></dt>
          <dd/>

          <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.core.node.InitializationComponent=XML</b></dt>
          <dd/>

          <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.core.domain.config.filename= </b></dt>
          <dd/>

          <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.install.path=${env_var:COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH}</b></dt>
          <dd/>

          <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.bootstrap.application=org.cougaar.core.node.Node</b></dt>
          <dd/>

         <dt><b>-Xms1m</b></dt>
          <dd/>

          <dt><b>-Xmx256m</b></dt>
          <dd/>

          <dt><b>-XX:ThreadStackSize=256</b></dt>
          <dd/>

        </dl>
        <p>
      </li>
      

    </ul>

    <h2>Importing a project from untarred demo-hello.jar</h2>
    <a name="import"/>
    <p>
      To import the Hello World project into any Eclipse workspace, do
      the following:
      <ol>
        <li>From the <i>File</i> menu select <i>Import...</i>.</li>

        <li>In the <i>Import Projects</i> dialog that pops up,
        open <i>General</i> and select <i>Existing Projects into
