    <title>Running Hello World in Eclipse</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This Cougaar demo has been set up so that it can easily be run
      in Eclipse, either in a new workspace created for that purpose,
      or in existing workspace if you already have one for
      Cougaar-related work.
    </p>
    <p> 
      We assume the reader is already familiar with Eclipse, and we
      recommend using Eclipse 3.3.2 or later.
    </p>

    <h2>Defining the "cougaar" User Library</h2>
    <p>
      Regardless of whether you create a new workspace or use an
      existing one, the first step is to create an Eclipse User
      Library containing the Cougaar jars.  You may also find this
      User Library useful for your own Cougaar work.
    </p>

    <p>
      To create a User Library in Eclipse, do the following:

      <ol>
        <li>open Preferences and navigate to <i>Java -> Build Path ->
      User Libraries</i>.</li>

        <li>Click <i>New</i> to create a new library.  Give it the
        name "cougaar".</li>

        <li>Select that library, click <i>Add Jars...</i> and add all
        the jars (and only jar files)
        from <code>$COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/lib</code></li>

        <li>Select the library again, click <i>Add Jars...</i> and add all
        the jars (and only jar files, e.g. not index.html)
        from <code>$COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/sys</code></li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Any projects that depend on Cougaar, include HelloWorld, can
    get at the Cougaar jars simply by including the "cougaar"
    User Library on the project's build path.
    </p>

    <h2>Running the Hello World demo in a new workspace</h2>
    <p>
      <ol>
        
        <li>Create a new Eclipse workspace.</li>

        <li>Define the "cougaar" User Library as described
        above.</li>

        <li>Import the HelloWorld project (see <a href="#import">below</a>
        if you don't know how to do this).</li>

        <li>Open the Run Dialog, expand the list of Java Applications,
        and select "hello".
        
      </ol>
      <p>The demo can now be run or debugged or profiled in Eclipse.
      </p>

    </p>

    <h2>Adding Hello World to your existing workspace</h2>
    <p>
      You may find it convenient to repeat the steps above in order to
    <a name="import"/>
    <p>
      To import the Hello World project into any Eclipse workspace, do
      the following:
      <ol>
        <li>From the <i>File</i> menu select <i>Import...</i>.</li>

        <li>In the <i>Import Projects</i> dialog that pops up,
        open <i>General</i> and select <i>Existing Projects into
        Workspace</i> and click <i>Next</i></li>
        
        <li>Select <i>Select root directory</i>, click the
        adjacent <i>Browse...</i> button and in the file browser that
        pops up, navigate to the parent directory of "hello" and click
        the <i>Choose</i> button.</li>

        <li> The "hello" project should now be listed and checked
        in the <i>Import Projects</i> dialog.  Click the <i>Finish</i>
        button and you're done. </li>
        
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Running your own Cougaar society</h2>
    <p> Once you have the "hello" in your own Cougaar workspace you
    can easily run your societies in Eclipse by cloning the "hello"
    example and making a few modifications.  To make a clone, simply
    open <i>Open Run Dialog</i>, select "hello", and click the duplicate
    button in the toolbar (second from left).  Now change its name to
    something more meaningful, change the project to be your project
    and click <i>Apply</i> to save the changes so far.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point switch from the <i>Main</i> tab to
      the <i>Arguments</i> tab.  Change the <i>Working directory</i>
      to something meaningful for your project, typically the
      directory that contains the society runtime xml and webtomcat if
      you use servlets.  For portability it's best to make this
      relative to the project root if it all possible, which will
      allow you to use the Eclipse reference ${project_loc:xxx}, where
      xxx is the project name.  The "hello" configuration is set up
      this way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, you need to adjust the VM arguments to be suitable for
      your society.  The exact details depend on the society, but in
      general the VM args can be divided into three categories:
    </p>

    <ul>
    
      <li> Some values are society-specific and must be adjusted to
      match your project.  These include:

        <dl>
           <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.society.path=${project_loc:hello}</b></dt>
           <dd>
             Replace the value with location of your project root.
           </dd>

           <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.runtime.path=${project_loc:hello}/run</b></dt>
           <dd>
             Replace value with the run (working) directory in your project root.
           </dd>

           <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.society.file=${project_loc:hello}/configs/HelloSociety.xml</b></dt>
           <dd>
             Replace the value with a path to your society xml.
             Typically this would be a 'configs' directory under the
             project root.
           </dd>

           <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.runtime.file=SingleNodeRuntime.xml</b></dt>
           <dd>
             Replace the value with the path to your society runtime
             xml, relative to the run (working) directory you set above.
           </dd>

           <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.node.name=Node1</b></dt>
           <dd>
             Replace the value with name of the node from the society xml file you want to run.
           </dd>

        </dl>
      </li>
 
      <li> Other values define the runtime environment,
      but you might need to adjust them.  These include:
        <dl>
          <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.name.server=NameServer@localhost:8888</b></dt>
          <dd>
            If your society includes multiple nodes running on
            multiple hosts, replace 'localhost' with the fully
            qualified domain name of the host running the node that
            contains the NameServer agent.
          </dd>

          <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.society.xsl.param.template=single_node</b></dt>
          <dd>
            Adjust this if you want to run your society in an environment other than a
            stand alone node. (see 
            <a href="http://cougaar.cougaar.org/software/latest/doc/OnlineManual/Templates.html">
            templates</a>)
            
          </dd>

          <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.society.xsl.param.planning=false</b></dt>
          <dd>
            Set to true, if you want to use the task servlet to inspect objects on the blackboard
          </dd>

          <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.core.agent.quiet=true</b></dt>
          <dd>
            Set to false, if you want to see +/- printed on the console 
            for each message sent and received.
          </dd>

          <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.core.agent.heartbeat=false</b></dt>
          <dd>
            Set to true, if you want a "." printed on the console every 5 seconds.
          </dd>

          <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.core.logging.config.filename=logging.props</b></dt>
          <dd>
            If you want to use your own log4j properties file, put
            the path to that file here.
          </dd>

 
        </dl>

      </li>


      <li> Some values are fixed for all societies.  These include:
        <dl>
          <dt><b>-Dorg.xml.sax.driver=com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.parsers.SAXParser</b></dt>
          <dd/>

          <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.core.node.InitializationComponent=XML</b></dt>
          <dd/>

          <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.core.domain.config.filename= </b></dt>
          <dd/>

          <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.install.path=${env_var:COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH}</b></dt>
          <dd/>

          <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.bootstrap.application=org.cougaar.core.node.Node</b></dt>
          <dd/>

          <dt><b>-Dorg.cougaar.core.persistence.verifyJavaIOPatch=false</b></dt>
          <dd/>
         <dt><b>-Xms1m</b></dt>
          <dd>
            Adjust this if you expect your societies memory
            requirements to be different.
          </dd>

          <dt><b>-Xmx256m</b></dt>
          <dd>
            Adjust this if you expect your societies memory
            requirements to be different.
          </dd>

          <dt><b>-XX:ThreadStackSize=256</b></dt>
          <dd>
            Adjust this if you expect your societies memory
            requirements to be different.
          </dd>

        </dl>
        <p>
      </li>
