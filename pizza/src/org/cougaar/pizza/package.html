<body>
The Pizza Party Domain and application.
<p>
This module follows a typical package structure for Cougaar
applications. Here at the root is the Domain, the Factory if any, and
a {@link org.cougaar.pizza.Constants} file.
<p>
Below this package, are packages for utilities, assets (sometimes
called "ldm" with "asset" as a sub-package), plugins, servlets, and
perhaps others (in our case, relays).
