This package defines servlets for use with the Pizza Party
application.
<p>
The {@link org.cougaar.pizza.servlet.HistoryServlet} is a generic servlet for monitoring changes to the
blackboard. Use the {@link org.cougaar.pizza.servlet.HistoryServletFriendly} interface to allow the
servlet to show meaningful information about your blackboard objects.
<p>
The {@link org.cougaar.pizza.servlet.PizzaPreferenceServlet} is the
main UI for the pizza party app. It shows what the application is
about, what has happened so far, how guests have RSVPed, and the
status of the pizza orders.
