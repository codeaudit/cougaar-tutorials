This package defines servlets for use with the Pizza Party
application.
<p>
The {@link org.cougaar.pizza.servlet.HistoryServlet} is a generic servlet for monitoring changes to the
blackboard. Use the {@link org.cougaar.pizza.servlet.HistoryServletFriendly} interface to allow the
servlet to show meaningful information about your blackboard objects.
<p>
The {@link org.cougaar.pizza.servlet.PizzaPreferenceServlet} is used to display who has been invited to
the party and what kinds of pizza they want. It is the main UI for the
pizza party app.
