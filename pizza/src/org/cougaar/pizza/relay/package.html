This package contains the definitions of the Relays used to invite
guests to the pizza party.
<p>
Note the use of separate Classes for the Source (created by the
sender, Alice), Target (the version of the Relay seen by the
recipients of the invitation), and 
TargetRelayFactory (creates the Target objects in the destination
agent blackboards). 
This makes the code easier to read and slightly
less error-prone. Many implementations however will use a single class
for all of these. 
The {@link org.cougaar.pizza.relay.RSVPReply} is the Response object set on the Relay.Targets.
