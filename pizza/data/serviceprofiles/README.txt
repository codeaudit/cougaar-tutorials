This test application can utilize the Cougaar service discovery capability
to find pizza providers. Service discovery uses per-agent service profiles
for each agent that is registering services. The file 
CIP/pizza/data/serviceprofiles/<agent name>.profile.owl represents the service
capabilities of the agent in OWL format. (OWL is a Web Ontology language. See
http://www.w3.org/2004/OWL/ for more information.) 

For this application, there are 2 agents which provide pizzas - Dominos and 
JoesLocalPizzaShack. In addition, JoesLocalPizzaShack also provides salads.
You can look at JoesLocalPizzaShack.profile.owl and Dominos.profile.owl to see example service profiles. The profiles also define a WSDL service
grounding which is ignored by the test application. (See 
CIP/pizza/data/servicegroundings for examples.)

The service profiles (and associated service groundings) were generated by
running the generateOWL perl script. The script uses 2 input files. 
agent-input.txt defines the service capability of the agent in terms of 
COUGAAR Roles. profile-template.txt is a template service profile. To generate
the files from  scratch -
	(a) If Perl is not installed on your computer, you can download it 
	from http://www.activestate.com.
    
	(d) cd CIP/pizza/data/serviceprofiles.

	(d) perl generateDAML.pl agent-input.txt profile-template.txt
