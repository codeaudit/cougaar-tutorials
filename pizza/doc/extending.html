<h1>Extending the Pizza Party Application</h1>
There are many pieces of the pizza party application which you could
re-use in your own appliccations - as is, or with slight
modifications.
<p>
The HistoryServlet (org.cougaar.pizza.servlet.HistoryServlet, javadoc
<a href="http://cougaar.cougaar.org/software/11.4/javadoc/pizza/doc/api/org/cougaar/pizza/servlet/HistoryServlet.html">here</a>) is a
generic servlet that can be added to other applications as is. If you
want the "Comment" column for your custom objects to be richer, you can
use the HistoryServletFriendly (<a
href="http://cougaar.cougaar.org/software/11.4/javadoc/pizza/doc/api/org/cougaar/pizza/servlet/HistoryServletFriendly.html">here</a>)
interface to mark your objects to display better. See its Javadoc for usage.
<p>
The Service Discovery plugins in the pizza party app are all minor
extensions of simple plugins that you can use as is in your
application. Most applications using service discovery will be able to
use these as is. For details on these plugins, see the
<a
href="http://cougaar.cougaar.org/software/11.4/javadoc/pizza/doc/api/org/cougaar/pizza/plugin/package-summary.html">org.cougaar.pizza.plugin
Javadoc</a>. In general, you will be able to use these plugins most readily when: 
<ul>
<li>You have Community-based Yellow Pages
(that is, you are using communities, some of which are of
CommunityType "YPCommunity" and name a "YPServerAgent". See the "MA"
agent and its components for detais on building a YPServerAgent.</li>
<li>You are looking up providers in the yellow pages by the name of
the Role they provide. If you want to do more complex lookups, you
will need something more complex than the

<li>Providers are constant: once they agree to provide a service, they
are always willing to provide that service. They mail still fail
individual Tasks, but will not revoke the relationship
altogether.</li>
<li>For other restrictions, see the Javadoc for the individual <a
href="http://cougaar.cougaar.org/software/11.4/javadoc/pizza/doc/api/org/cougaar/pizza/plugin/package-summary.html">plugins</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <a href="http://cougaar.cougaar.org/software/11.4/javadoc/pizza/doc/api/org/cougaar/pizza/plugin/InvitePlugin.html">InvitePlugin</a>
and <a href="http://cougaar.cougaar.org/software/11.4/javadoc/pizza/doc/api/org/cougaar/pizza/plugin/RSVPPlugin.html">RSVPPlugin</a>
show how to use a Relay to send a query to a set of agents. They also show how to use a Community to
define an AttributeBasedAddress, and use that as the target of a message.
<p>
The <a href="http://cougaar.cougaar.org/software/11.4/javadoc/pizza/doc/api/org/cougaar/pizza/servlet/PizzaPreferenceServlet.html">PizzaPreferenceServlet</a> shows how to use a Blackboard Query in a
servlet to get a snapshot of the Blackboard state.
<p>
The <a href="http://cougaar.cougaar.org/software/11.4/javadoc/pizza/doc/api/org/cougaar/pizza/plugin/PlaceOrderPlugin.html">PlaceOrderPlugin</a> shows how to use the PlanningFactory and the
PluginHelper to create Tasks and put Preferences on them, and manage
the AllocationResults that flow back.
<p>
For an example on how to define new Asset types, define new
PropertyGroups, and use them, the Kitchen and Pizza assets provide
nice (documented) examples. See the <a
href="http://cougaar.cougaar.org/software/11.4/javadoc/pizza/doc/api/org/cougaar/pizza/asset/package-summary.html">asset
package javadoc</a> and <a
