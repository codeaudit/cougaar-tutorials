 <center><h1>Pizza Party Planner Application</h1></center>
 <hr>
 <h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
 <p>The Pizza Party Planner application is a simple 8 agent society that 
exercises many key Cougaar modules, while staying relatively
simple. It demonstrates a little of what Cougaar can do, and key
 features. It is also a good test to ensure key pieces of Cougaar are
still working, and a good set of sample code for modeling custom
components off of.</p>

 <h2>2. SETUP</h2>
 <p>Ensure that you installed cougaar.zip and cougaar-support.zip</a> and
that your COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable points to the
 directory where those were unzipped. It will also help if you put
 COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/bin on your PATH.</p>

 <h2>3. RUNNING</h2>
 <p>To run this application, you run the 2 Cougaar Nodes that make up the system:<br><br>
 [In a command line window]<br>
 % <i>cd COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/pizza/configs/pizzaparty</i><br>
 % <i>cougaar SDPizzaNode1.xml</i><br>
 <br>
 [Start another window on the same machine]<br>
 % <i>cd COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/pizza/configs/pizzaparty</i><br>
 % <i>cougaar SDPizzaNode2.xml</i><br>
 </p>

 <h2>4. EXPECTED OUTPUT</h2>

<h2>5. OTHER OUTPUT</h2>
<p>As with all Cougaar applications, user interfaces for the Pizza
Application are available as web pages.<br>
<p>
The main interface for the Pizza Party is the "/pizza" servlet,
available at runtime at: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
href="http://localhost:8800/$Alice/pizza">http://localhost:8800/$Alice/pizza</a>.
<br>
<p>
To see all the servlets associated with the party planner, Alice,
navigate at runtime to the "/list" servlet: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://localhost:8800/$Alice/list">http://localhost:8800/$Alice/list</a> <br>
</p>
<h2>6. LEARN MORE</h2>
<p>Read more about the <a href="flow.html">story and flow</a> of the
pizza party applcation: What is supposedly going on? What are the
components involved?
<p>
<p>These components may be re-used in your application, or modified
slightly for your purposes. <a href="extending.html">Here</a> we
discuss how you might use this code for your own purposes.
<p>
<p>Finally, this example includes some interesting <a href="design.html">design
decisions</a>. You may read about these to learn more about some advanced
Cougaar development topics.<br>
